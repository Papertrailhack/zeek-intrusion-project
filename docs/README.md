# Network Intrusion Detection using Zeek and Wireshark

**Analyst:** Brett Banks  
**Date:** June 1, 2025

## Overview

This project simulates and detects common network intrusions such as:

- Cleartext FTP credential leaks
- Network scanning
- Basic DNS/FTP traffic analysis

The goal was to analyze network behavior using tcpdump, Wireshark, and Zeek, then summarize key findings in a SOC-style report.

## Lab Setup

| Component     | Description                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Kali Linux    | Attacker & Monitor (Zeek + Wireshark)  |
| Windows 10    | Victim with FTP service                |
| Network       | Host-Only (192.168.84.0/24)            |
| Capture Tool  | `tcpdump -i eth1 -w ftp_test.pcap`     |

## Tools Used

- Zeek
- Wireshark
- tcpdump
- ftp, nslookup, nmap

## Key Actions

1. Initiated an FTP session to Windows target using test credentials.
2. Captured network traffic using tcpdump.
3. Parsed traffic with Zeek.
4. Investigated Zeek logs (conn.log, etc.) for suspicious activity.

## Summary of Findings

- **Exposed FTP Credentials**  
  - `USER testuser`, `PASS weakpass`  
  - Protocol: FTP (port 21)  
  - Risk: Credentials transmitted in cleartext  
  - MITRE ATT&CK ID: `T1078 â€“ Valid Accounts`

## Takeaway

Even simple attacks are easily captured using the right monitoring tools. With Zeek and Wireshark, defenders can gain visibility into insecure protocols and improve alerting for credential misuse.
